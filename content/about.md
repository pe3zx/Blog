**Pandora's Box** is my fourth attempt to migrate the blog engine to something new and more flexible compare to [the old one](https://pe3zx.blogspot.com). This blog is a place for cybersecurity technical-focused posts, especially in both offensive and defensive security. Mostly, the blog will be written in Thai to provide technical resources which rarely found in Thailand's cybersecurity industry.

- Incident handling and response
